# Oculus

Oculus is a tool for wardriving. It utilizes the 'Scapy' library for wardriving, capturing and analyzing Wi-Fi packets. It extracts information (such as SSID, BSSID, security mode, and channel) from the packet and then securely sends this data to a specified server in real-time using SSH ('paramiko' library), appending the information to the 'cred.txt' file.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/just1nn1t/Oculus.git
```

## Requirements

```python

pip install scapy
pip install paramiko

sudo ifconfig <interface> down
sudo iwconfig <interface> mode monitor
sudo ifconfig <interface> up

```

## Setup a SFTP server

```bash

(in this case in Ubuntu/Debian)

Install OpenSSH server:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install openssh-server

Edit configuration file (usually located at /etc/ssh/sshd_config):
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
subsystem sftp internal-sftp <-- make sure it's there or uncommented

Restart SSH service:
sudo service ssh restart

Create SFTP user:
sudo adduser <your_username>

Test it by:
sftp <your_username>@<your_server_ip>

```
