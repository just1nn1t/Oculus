# Oculus

Oculus is a tool for wardriving with Raspberry pi. It utilizes the 'Scapy' library for wardriving, capturing and analyzing Wi-Fi packets. It extracts information (such as SSID, BSSID, security mode, and channel) from the packet and then securely sends this data to a specified server in real-time using SSH ('paramiko' library), appending the information to the 'cred.txt' file.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/just1nn1t/Oculus.git
```

## Requirements

```python

pip install scapy
pip install paramiko

sudo ifconfig <interface> down
sudo iwconfig <interface> mode monitor
sudo ifconfig <interface> up

```
